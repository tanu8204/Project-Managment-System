# Project Management System

This project is a simple Project Management System implemented using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing projects, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting project information.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Set Up MySQL Database**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `projectDB`.
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL database configuration:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/projectDB
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

3. **Build and Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **Access the API Endpoints**:
   Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
   - Base URL: `http://localhost:8069/api/projects`
